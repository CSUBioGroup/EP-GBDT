# EP-GBDT
EP-GBDT is a computational approach for essential protein prediction by using only sequence information.

# Requirements
numpy==1.18.1

scikit-learn==0.23.1

imblearn==0.7.0

# Usage
In this GitHub project, we give a demo to show how EP-GBDT works. 

In the Raw data folder, we provide the raw protein sequences and their labels. You can use them for other sequence-based essential protein prediction. In the Processed features folder, we provide the processed protein sequence features obtained by Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) tool. In the predicted results by 8 centrality methods folder, we provide the raw PPI network and the results of 8 centrality methods. data_h.pkl and data_y.pkl are used to store the training and test sets which are generated by random seed of `202010086`, respectively. The random seed is used to ensure that you can produce the same results as in the paper.

In our demo, we provide a python file (train_main.py) to train and evaluate the ensemble classifier. You can train the model with a very simple way by using the command below:

`python train_main.py --type h3 --threshold 0.5`


If you want to tune some hyper-parameters and random seed, you can change values of them in train_main.py. 

In the saved_model folder, we provide the trained model.

The other details can see the paper and the codes.
